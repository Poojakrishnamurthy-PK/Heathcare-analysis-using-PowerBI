Healthcare Data Analysis and Visualization 🏥
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to gain insights into patient care, hospital costs, disease prevalence, and departmental performance. Using Power BI, the project transforms complex hospital data into interactive dashboards for effective decision-making and resource management.

📊 Dataset Overview
The healthcare dataset contains detailed information about patients and hospital operations, including:

Year: Timeline of recorded health data

Health Conditions: Disease categories like Hypertension, Diabetes, Covid-19, etc.

Cases: Number of reported cases per condition

Mortality Rate: Percentage of deaths associated with each condition

Treatment Cost: Costs incurred per patient and disease

Insurance Coverage: Amount covered by insurance providers

Outcome: Patient status (Recovered, Critical, Deceased)

Department & Gender: Patient distribution across hospital departments and gender

✅ Project Tasks
🔧 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values and null entries in critical fields

Remove duplicate and irrelevant records

Correct data types for numerical and date fields

Standardize column names for clarity

Create derived columns such as mortality percentage and total cases trend

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze patient distribution by disease and department

Explore trends in admissions, costs, and outcomes

Visualize data using bar charts, line charts, pie charts, stacked bars, and donut charts

🏗 Dashboard Development
Build interactive Power BI dashboards with KPIs, filters, and slicers

Track patient counts, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and departmental performance

Use visualizations to highlight trends in disease prevalence, costs, and outcomes

📊 DAX Measures
Total Patients: Count of all admitted patients

Total Cost: Sum of treatment costs

Avg Stay: Average length of hospital stay

Recovery Rate %: Percentage of patients who recovered

Mortality Rate %: Percentage of deceased patients

Critical %: Percentage of patients in critical condition

Avg Cost per Patient: Average cost per patient

Insurance Coverage %: Percentage of cost covered by insurance

📌 Insights & Interpretation
1,500 patients analyzed with an average stay of ~7.3 days

Total treatment cost ≈ 38.11M; average cost per patient ~25.4K

Recovery rate: 84%, Mortality: 5%, Critical cases: 11%

Insurance covers 58% of total costs

Hypertension and Migraine show high treatment costs

Cardiology has the highest patient load, Pulmonology the longest stays

Departments and diseases with higher costs and patient load identified for resource optimization

🛠 Technologies Used
Power BI: Dashboard development and visualization

DAX: Data calculations and measures

Power Query: Data cleaning and preprocessing

Excel/CSV: Data storage and manipulation
